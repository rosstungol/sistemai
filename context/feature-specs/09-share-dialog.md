Add a `Share` button to the editor navbar that opens the share dialog.

Owners can:
- Invite collaborators by email
- View current collaborators
- Remove collaborators
- Copy project link with temporary "Copied!" feedback

Collaborators can:
- View the collaborators list only
- Not invite, remove, or manage access

## Clerk User Data

Collaborators are stored by email in the database.

User Clerk Backend API to enrich collaborator emails with:
- Display name
- Avatar image

If a Clerk user is not found for an email, fall back to showing the email only.

## Implementation

Add the required API logic for:
- Listing collaborators
- Inviting collaborators
- Removing collaborators

Enforce ownership server-side for invite and remove actions.

Do not add a local user table.

## Check when done
- Share dialog opens from the workspace
- Owners can invite and remove collaborators
- Collaborators see read-only access
- Collaborator names/avatars load from Clerk when available
- `bun run build` passes
